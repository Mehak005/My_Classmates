## Project Description

My classmate is a simple React app that shows a list of classmates on separate cards. 
Each card displays the classmates name, favourite food and favourite color and has a like button which increases the count when clicked respectively.
The app uses array of list of people to create each card and react components. Bootstrap is used for styling and to make the layout responsive.
The project is deployed on GitHub.

## Generative AI usage

## How I used it?
I used generative AI to get general guidance on React and Bootstrap usage, and to clarify best practise for structuring components.

## AI generated parts:
The core outline of the Card App components was suggested by AI.

## My own contribution:
I customized the data and styling myself, wrote the final code and integrated the like button functionality. 
Handled all deployment steps.

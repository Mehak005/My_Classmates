## Project Description

Student Connect is an interactive ReactJS-based student directory that allows users to:
- **Create, Modify, and Delete** student profiles.
- **Like other students’ profiles** (likes increase on button click).
- **View profiles in a Table format** with sorting and filtering options.
- **Dark Mode Support** for an improved UI experience.

The app **dynamically renders student profiles** from an array using React’s `useState` and `.map()`.  
It is **styled using Bootstrap** for a clean, responsive layout and deployed on **GitHub Pages**.



## Generative AI Usage

## How I used AI?
I used generative AI to get:
- Guidance on React and Bootstrap best practices.
- Clarifications on component structuring for better maintainability.
- Suggestions for improving table sorting and filtering.

## AI-Generated Parts
- The initial component outline for profile rendering.
- General suggestions on React State Management (`useState`).
- Example implementations for Bootstrap styling.

## My Own Contribution
Customized all data and structured final implementation.
Implemented Like button functionality & form validation. 
Integrated Dark Mode and localStorage persistence.
Handled Deployment, Table Sorting/Filtering, and Friend Request features.
